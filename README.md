# EduApplication

## Overview

EduApplication is a Flask-based educational platform that allows users to access programming and cloud courses while tracking learning progress.
The platform supports multiple course categories including **C, C++, Java, Python, AWS, and Azure**.

The application also includes **file uploads, user authentication, course tracking, and analytics**.
For DevOps practices, the project is containerized using **Docker** and automated using **Jenkins CI/CD**.

# Storage System

This project uses **JSON and text-based storage instead of a database**.

### User Accounts

Stored in:

```
users.txt
```

Contains registered users.

---

### User Profiles

Stored in:

```
user_profiles.json
```

Stores profile information of users.

---

### Course Progress

Stored in:

```
student_progress.json
```

Tracks the progress of each student in different courses.

---

### Timetable Data

Stored in:

```
student_timetables.json
```

Stores student schedules.

---

### AI Analytics

Stored in:

```
ai_analytics.json
```

Stores analytics and course insights.

# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

Jenkins automatically:

1. Pulls latest code from GitHub
2. Builds Docker image
3. Runs container

---

# Jenkinsfile

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        IMAGE_NAME = "eduvault"
    }

    stages {

        stage('Clone Repository') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/VarshithChand/Eduapplication.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME:latest .'
            }
        }

        stage('Run Container') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker run -d -p 5000:5000 $IMAGE_NAME:latest'
